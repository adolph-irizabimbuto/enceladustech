            It's ironic that in this increasingly anonymous age of modern technology we have regressed to a Neanderthal mindset, since leaving thinly veiled "comments" under Instagram posts on the guises of "interaction" has become the social norm. Social interactions became disingenuous the day we validated, vouched, verified, vindicated, and gauged the 
            veritableness everything on social media platforms. 
            <br><br>
            I understand that it's a societal issue to gravitate towards confirmation bias and sensationalism, but it takes a force of will to reject the need to conform to this social construct and to resist the urge to publicise every aspect of your life. It's necessary to reduce the number of hours we spend on these platforms in lieu of long-term happiness. Although it would be unfair to say that 
            Social Media exists at the nexus of loneliness and depression, you have to think that and any overindulgence of it only makes things worse surely.
            <br><br>
            These platforms are so successful because of our need to belong, which is an involuntary, instinctive and visceral reaction that is deep-rooted in human nature. 
            A recent study found that 42% of the population frequented at least 1 social media platform, that's 3.2 billion people interacting on places that encourage dishonesty, deceit, and reward pretentiousness with stupid likes that often lead to brand deals and endorsements.
            <br><br>
            Unsurprisingly, of the 3.2 billion users, a majority of them are aged between 14-20, this statistic is mostly what inspired this piece initially,
            Teenagers, for the most part, are going through a weird stage in their lives where they are probably facing an identity crisis, battling pressures to fit in and trying to live up to unrealistic and unattainable beauty standards.
            So the fact that something as problematic as social media is a big part of this already emotionally draining and confusing journey for teenagers is troubling.
        
            <br><br>
            Social Media is deceptively effective at giving us what we yearn for, which is an identity, but regardless of how sophomoric it may seem on the surface I honestly believe that 
            the hardest thing for any one person to know is themselves and social media only complicates that already complex, perplexing, and arduous journey.

            Fremantle is alright,  here’s why:
            <br><br>
            According to <a href="https://www.europeanproceedings.com/article/10.15405/epsbs.2020.03.03.18"> <b><i>Dickman’s 5 A’'s”,</i></b></a> a theory that suggests that a tourist destination needs to fulfil the "5 A’s" (Access, Accomodation, Amenities, Activities, and Attractions) to be sensible and sustainable. Fremantle might be the perfect tourtist destination.
            <br><br>
            Fremantles’ strength is its attractions and although they may not be as world-famous as The Sydney Opera House or the Sydney Harbour Bridge, they offer something unique that the aforementioned destinations lack, they are a rare blend of historical heritage, a cross between the 21st Century Australia and the Victorian 19th Century.
            <br><br>
            It's is a secret sensation, a seaside gem, an architectural masterpiece that even Antoni Gaudi would be astounded by, because it is mesmerising in its layout, misleading in its simplicity, and magnetising in its beauty, a beauty that seemingly remains unchanged. With that said Fremantle still doesn’t feel like it was built solely for attracting tourists, (although  its awe-inspiring design made that inevitable) 
       
            <br><br>
            Fremantle feels like what Fremantle is, a backdrop to the best-preserved 19th-century port streetscape in the world, an electric and eccentric blend of fabulous artisanal food, handcrafted beers, great coffee, quirky boutiques, pristine turquoise beaches, and a fresh sea breeze.
